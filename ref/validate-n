1. N=0, execute instructions in `ref/validate-tier`

2. Implement all missing/incomplete/inaccurate functionality -- including, but not limited to:
   - primary functionality
   - tests per the design documentation (doc/design/tier-<N>/<module>/tests.md)
   - benchmarks per perf.md (for Tier 2-4 modules)
   - regressions

3. Resolve all discrepancies -- retain reasonable additional functionality

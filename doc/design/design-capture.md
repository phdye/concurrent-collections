# Design Capture — Concurrent Collections

## Purpose

This document provides the technical home base for the `concurrent_collections` project. The goal is to create production-ready, lock-free data structures for Python 3.13+ that scale on free-threaded Python while remaining competitive on GIL-enabled Python. The implementation uses Rust via PyO3 for performance and memory safety.

This documentation set enables:
- Implementation from the ground up
- Formal verification of concurrency properties
- Team collaboration and onboarding

### Formal Specification Method

| Primary | Secondary | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| TLA+ | Property-based testing | TLA+ for concurrency invariants; PBT for implementation validation |

**Rationale:** Lock-free data structures require formal reasoning about linearizability, progress guarantees, and memory reclamation safety. TLA+ excels at modeling these properties. Property-based testing (proptest/quickcheck) validates implementations against specs.

## Open Design Questions

| Question | Options | Impact | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| SMR thread registration | Explicit register/unregister vs automatic | API ergonomics, safety | Open |
| Frozen snapshot allocation | Copy to new structure vs compact array | Memory, iteration perf | Open |
| Queue unbounded growth | Linked segments vs realloc | Memory patterns | Open |
| LCRQ segment size | Fixed 1024 vs configurable | Cache behavior | Open |
| Backoff tuning | Fixed params vs adaptive | Contention response | Open |
| PyO3 GIL handling | Release GIL during Rust ops vs hold | Python interop, performance | Open |

---

## Resolved Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| Implementation language | Rust via PyO3 | Memory safety, performance, no GIL contention in Rust | C extension (manual memory), Cython (still Python-bound) |
| Iterator semantics | Weakly consistent default, snapshot() for frozen | Matches Java, performance | Snapshot-only (memory cost) |
| Custom comparators | Natural default + Python callable option | Flexibility for Python users | Natural only (limiting) |
| Bounded containers | recipes module, not core | Minority use case | Core class (API bloat) |
| GIL adaptation | Runtime detect, dual backend | Transparent to user | Single backend (suboptimal) |
| Frozen type | FrozenSkipListMap (hashable) | Can be dict key | Return dict (loses ordering) |
| SMR scheme | Epoch-based primary (crossbeam-style), DEBRA+ configurable | Bounded memory, good perf | Hazard pointers (overhead) |
| Error handling | Python exceptions via PyO3 | Idiomatic Python | Return codes (not Pythonic) |
| Thread safety | All types are Send + Sync in Rust | Safe concurrent access | Single-threaded only (limiting) |

| File | Purpose | Required |
|------|---------|----------|
| `design.md` | Architecture, algorithms, data structures | **MANDATORY** |
| `spec.md` | Contracts, invariants, behavior | **MANDATORY** |
| `tests.md` | Test coverage mapping | **MANDATORY** |

### Conditional Documents

| File | When Required |

---

## TLA+ Specification Guidance

### Required For

All Tier 2-3 modules require TLA+ specifications:

| Module Category | Key Properties to Model |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| SMR (Tier 2) | Safe reclamation, eventual freeing, bounded memory |
| Skip List (Tier 3) | Linearizability, ordering, lock-freedom |
| Queue (Tier 3) | FIFO ordering, lock-freedom, bounded size |
| Stack (Tier 3) | LIFO ordering, lock-freedom |

### Key Invariants

```tla
\* Safe Memory Reclamation
SafeReclamation ==
    \A node \in retired:
        Freed(node) => \A t \in Threads: ~Accessing(t, node)

\* Skip list ordering preserved
SkipListOrdered ==
    \A node \in Nodes:
        node.next[0] # NIL => node.key < node.next[0].key

\* Queue FIFO
QueueFIFO ==
    \A i, j \in EnqueueIndices:
        i < j => DequeueOrder(i) < DequeueOrder(j)

\* Lock-free progress
LockFreeProgress ==
    []<>(\E t \in Threads: Completes(t))
```

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

| Concern | Affected Tiers | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Error handling | All | Python exceptions via PyO3, Rust `Result<T, E>` internally |
| Thread safety | 2-4 | Linearizability required, Rust `Send + Sync` bounds |
| Memory safety | 2-3 | Rust ownership + SMR for lock-free structures |
| Platform abstraction | 0, 3 | x86-64 vs ARM64 via `cfg(target_arch)` |
| GIL compatibility | 0, 3, 4 | Dual backend support, release GIL during Rust ops |
| PyO3 integration | 4 | Python object lifecycle, reference counting |
| Unsafe code | 2-3 | Minimized, well-documented, MIRI-tested |

---

## Semantic Requirements

The implementation must provide these guarantees:

| Requirement | Specification | Modules Affected |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Linearizability | All operations appear atomic | All Tier 3-4 |
| Lock-free progress | System-wide progress guaranteed | All Tier 3-4 (lock-free backend) |
| Wait-free progress | Per-thread progress bounded | WaitFreeQueue only |
| FIFO ordering | Queue maintains insertion order | scq, lcrq, wcq |
| LIFO ordering | Stack maintains LIFO order | treiber |
| Sorted ordering | Map/Set maintain key order | skiplist, bst |
| Memory safety | No use-after-free, no leaks | All |
| Snapshot consistency | Frozen views are immutable | Frozen* classes |

---

## Performance Targets

| Operation | Target (single-thread) | Target (8 threads, free-threaded Python) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| SkipListMap get | 2M ops/sec | 12M+ ops/sec |
| SkipListMap put | 1.5M ops/sec | 10M+ ops/sec |
| Queue enqueue/dequeue | 3M ops/sec | 20M+ ops/sec |
| Stack push/pop | 3M ops/sec | 18M+ ops/sec |

*Note: Rust implementation via PyO3 provides significant speedup over pure Python while maintaining Pythonic API. GIL is released during Rust operations for maximum concurrency on free-threaded Python.*
